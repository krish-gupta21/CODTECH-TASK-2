# Overview of the Project

### Project: Web Application Penetration testing

This project focuses on identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in the **Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)**. Using tools like **Nmap**, **Nikto**, and **SQLMap**, it demonstrates common security flaws and highlights key security practices.

### Objective
To identify security risks in web applications, practicing with tools and techniques used in real-world penetration testing.

### Tools and Key Findings

**Nmap**
- Identified open ports and services, though OS detection was inconclusive.

### Nikto
- Missing security headers (e.g., `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`).
- Directory indexing in sensitive folders.
- Exposure of `.git` and `.dockerignore` files.

### SQLMap
- SQL Injection vulnerability on the `id` parameter.
- Extracted user login credentials and database structure.

### Disclaimer
This testing was performed in a safe environment for educational purposes only. Unauthorized testing on real applications without consent is both illegal and unethical.
